# Fantasy Premier League Squad Optimisation

## Introduction
Fantasy Premier League is a game where you can pick 15 players, each has its own price and scores points for your team every gameweek based on their real-life performance. In the beginning, you have a budget of £100 million, and there are other limitations. The goal of this script is to build a squad that can maximise your points under constraints.

## Data required
1. Player Name
2. Team Name
3. Position (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Forward)
4. Price/Cost of the player
5. Projected points (Everyone's projection can be different based on the input and approaches)

## Rules
1. Each squad should have a total of 15 players, including:
- 2 Goalkeepers
- 5 Defenders
- 5 Midfielders
- 3 Forwards
2. The total value of the squad must not exceed the budget (£100m initially)
3. The squad cannot have more than 3 players from the same team

## Result
This is my squad starting from gameweek 1 2022/23. Good luck to me!
